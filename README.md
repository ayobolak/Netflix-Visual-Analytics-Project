## ‚úÖ Tasks Completed

### 1. Data Preparation
- Loaded and read the Netflix dataset.
- Cleaned and saved as `Netflix_shows_movies_cleaned.csv`.

### 2. Data Cleaning

  - `date_added` filled with the mode date.
  - `rating` filled with the mode rating.

### 3. Data Exploration
- Descriptive statistics and dataset summary explored.
- Basic frequency distributions and data types reviewed.

### 4. Data Visualization (Python)
Used **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for:

#### üìä Most Watched Genres
